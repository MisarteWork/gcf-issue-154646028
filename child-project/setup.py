    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name="child-project",  # Required
    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/

    # project code, see

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. If you
    # do not support Python 2, you can simplify this to '>=3.5' or similar, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
    python_requires=">=3.7, <4",
    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.

    # Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use packages that are properly arranged with
    # setuptools, but are not published to PyPI. In those cases, you can specify
    # a list of one or more dependency_links URLs where the package can
    # be downloaded, along with some additional hints, and setuptools
    # will find and install the package correctly.
